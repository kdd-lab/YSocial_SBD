# Building YSocial Executables

This document describes how to build standalone executables for YSocial using PyInstaller.

## Version Management

YSocial uses a centralized `VERSION` file in the project root that is automatically:
- Included in the PyInstaller executable
- Displayed in the splash screen on application startup
- Used by DMG packaging scripts for installer naming

### Updating the Version

Before building or releasing:

1. Edit the `VERSION` file:
   ```bash
   echo "2.1.0" > VERSION
   ```

2. Commit the change:
   ```bash
   git add VERSION
   git commit -m "Bump version to 2.1.0"
   ```

3. Create a release tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v2.1.0
   git push origin v2.1.0
   ```

The version will automatically be:
- Displayed in the splash screen: "v2.1.0 (Nalthis) 11/2025"
- Used in DMG filename: `YSocial-2.1.0.dmg`
- Embedded in the .app bundle metadata

## Automated Builds (GitHub Actions)

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Triggering Builds

The workflow can be triggered in three ways:

1. **Manual trigger**: Go to Actions → Build Executables → Run workflow
2. **Git tags**: Push a tag starting with `v` (e.g., `v2.1.0`)
3. **Releases**: Create a new release on GitHub

### Artifacts

Build artifacts are available for 90 days after the workflow completes:
- `YSocial-linux.tar.gz` - Linux executable
- `YSocial-macos.tar.gz` - macOS executable  
- `YSocial-windows.zip` - Windows executable

For releases, these artifacts are automatically attached to the release.

### Quick Start: macOS Automated Build

For macOS, use the automated build script that handles all steps including signing and DMG creation:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/YSocial

# Run automated build and package script
./packaging/build_and_package_macos.sh
```

This automatically performs:
1. PyInstaller build
2. Code signing with entitlements
3. DMG creation
4. Signing of .app bundle in DMG

For more details, see [MACOS_CODE_SIGNING.md](../MACOS_CODE_SIGNING.md).

### Manual Local Build

To build executables manually for testing:

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.11 (recommended)
2. All dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
4. Git submodules initialized: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

### Build Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone repository with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/YSocialTwin/YSocial.git
cd YSocial

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyinstaller

# 4. Download NLTK data
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('vader_lexicon')"

# 5. Create config directory if missing
mkdir -p config_files

# 6. Build with PyInstaller
pyinstaller y_social.spec --clean --noconfirm

# 7. (macOS only) Sign the executable for distribution
# This step is CRITICAL for macOS - without it, the app will hang on other machines
codesign --force --sign - \
  --entitlements entitlements.plist \
  --timestamp \
  --options runtime \
  dist/YSocial
```

**Important Notes:**
- The spec file already has `console=False` configured for Windows, which prevents the console window from showing
- Do **NOT** use the `--windowed` flag when building with a spec file - it will cause an error
- The `--windowed` flag is only for building directly from Python files, not spec files
- Console output is automatically suppressed when running the built executable on Windows
- **macOS**: Code signing step (#7) is **mandatory** for the executable to work on other macOS machines. See [MACOS_CODE_SIGNING.md](../MACOS_CODE_SIGNING.md) for details.

### Build Output

The executable will be a **single file** located in `dist/`:
- Linux/macOS: `dist/YSocial`
- Windows: `dist/YSocial.exe`

**Note**: The single-file executable extracts resources to a temporary directory at runtime. User data (experiments, databases, logs) is stored in the current working directory where you run the executable.

### Testing the Executable

```bash
# Linux/macOS
cd dist
./YSocial --help
./YSocial                    # Launches in desktop mode (default)

# Try browser mode instead
./YSocial --browser

# Windows
cd dist
YSocial.exe --help
YSocial.exe                  # Launches in desktop mode (default)

# Try browser mode instead
YSocial.exe --browser
```

The application now **launches in desktop mode by default** with a native window. Use `--browser` flag to open in a web browser instead.

## Desktop Mode (Default)

**Desktop mode is now the default!** YSocial uses PyWebview to provide a native window experience without browser chrome:

```bash
# Start normally (desktop mode is default)
./YSocial

# Customize window size
./YSocial --window-width 1600 --window-height 900

# Switch to browser mode if needed
./YSocial --browser
```

**Desktop mode features:**
- Native window without browser UI/chrome
- Integrated window controls (minimize, maximize, close)
- Better desktop integration
- Confirmation dialog on window close
- Resizable window with minimum size constraints

**Note:** Desktop mode requires a GUI environment. On Linux, it may require additional system packages depending on the backend used (GTK, Qt, etc.).

## Build Configuration Files

### `y_social.spec`
PyInstaller specification file that defines:
- Entry point (`y_social_launcher.py`)
- Data files to include (templates, static files, schemas)
- Hidden imports for dynamic dependencies
- Build options and exclusions

### `y_social_launcher.py`
Wrapper script that:
- Provides a clean command-line interface
- Supports both browser mode (default) and desktop mode (`--desktop`)
- Auto-opens browser/desktop window when server is ready
- Handles graceful shutdown
- Works with PyInstaller's bundled environment

### `y_social_desktop.py`
Desktop mode module that:
- Uses PyWebview to create native desktop windows
- Runs Flask server in background thread
- Provides desktop app experience without browser chrome
- Can be used standalone or via launcher

### `pyinstaller_hooks/`
Custom PyInstaller hooks:
- `hook-y_web.py`: Ensures y_web package data files are included
- `hook-webview.py`: Ensures pywebview platform-specific modules are included
- `runtime_hook_nltk.py`: Configures NLTK data paths at runtime

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with Import Errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that submodules are initialized: `git submodule status`

### Executable Fails to Start
- Check console output for error messages
- Verify NLTK data was downloaded during build
- The single-file executable extracts resources to a temporary location automatically

### Missing Templates or Static Files
- Check `y_social.spec` includes correct data paths
- Verify `pyinstaller_hooks/hook-y_web.py` is being used
- Rebuild with `--clean` flag

### Large Executable Size
The executable is large (~500MB-1GB) because it includes:
- Python interpreter
- All dependencies (Flask, SQLAlchemy, NLTK, scikit-learn, scipy, etc.)
- Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- Database schemas
- Submodules (YServer, YClient)

This is normal for PyInstaller-built applications with many dependencies.

**Note**: Some large packages like matplotlib and pandas are excluded since they're not needed for the core application.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Linux
- Executable is built for the same Linux distribution as the build machine
- May require additional system libraries on target machines
- Use Ubuntu-based systems for broadest compatibility

### macOS
- **IMPORTANT**: The executable must be properly signed to work on other machines
- Without proper signing, the app will hang at the splash screen on other macOS devices
- See [MACOS_CODE_SIGNING.md](../MACOS_CODE_SIGNING.md) for detailed signing instructions
- Quick signing for testing: `codesign --force --sign - --entitlements entitlements.plist --timestamp --options runtime dist/YSocial`
- For production releases, use a Developer ID certificate and notarize the app

### Windows
- Antivirus may flag the executable (false positive)
- Add to antivirus exceptions if needed
- UPX compression is enabled to reduce size

## Distribution

When distributing executables:

1. Include the README.txt created by the build process
2. Test on clean machines without Python installed
3. Provide instructions for first-time users
4. Mention system requirements (RAM, disk space)
5. Include link to full documentation

## CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-executables.yml`) handles:
- Multi-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Dependency caching
- Artifact creation and upload
- Release asset attachment
- README generation

See the workflow file for details and customization options.
