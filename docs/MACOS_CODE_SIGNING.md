# macOS Code Signing for YSocial PyInstaller Executable

This document explains how to properly code sign the YSocial PyInstaller executable for distribution on macOS.

## The Problem

When you build a PyInstaller single-file executable on macOS and run it on other machines, it may hang at the splash screen. This happens because:

1. **PyInstaller extracts to a temporary directory**: The single-file executable extracts its contents to `~/Library/Application Support/YSocial/_MEI<random>` at runtime
2. **macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned libraries**: On machines other than the build machine, macOS blocks the extracted unsigned libraries from loading
3. **Ad-hoc signing with `--deep` is insufficient**: The `--deep` flag doesn't properly sign nested components

## The Solution

YSocial now includes a `packaging/entitlements.plist` file that disables library validation for ad-hoc signed applications. This allows the executable to load its own extracted libraries.

### After Building with PyInstaller

After building the executable with `pyinstaller y_social.spec`, sign it with the entitlements file:

```bash
# For ad-hoc signing (testing and local distribution)
codesign --force --sign - \
  --entitlements packaging/entitlements.plist \
  --timestamp \
  --options runtime \
  dist/YSocial
```

**Important**: 
- DO NOT use the `--deep` flag (it's deprecated and doesn't work properly)
- The entitlements file is automatically embedded by PyInstaller, but you still need to sign the final executable
- Use `--options runtime` to enable Hardened Runtime

### For Production Distribution with Developer ID (Optional)

For wider distribution outside your organization, you can use a Developer ID certificate instead of ad-hoc signing:

```bash
# Automated (recommended)
./packaging/build_and_package_macos.sh --dev-id "Developer ID Application: Your Name"

# Or manually
codesign --force --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name" \
  --entitlements packaging/entitlements.plist \
  --timestamp \
  --options runtime \
  dist/YSocial

# Verify the signing
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 dist/YSocial

# Check the entitlements
codesign -d --entitlements - dist/YSocial
```

**When to use Developer ID:**
- Distributing to users outside your organization
- Want to avoid Gatekeeper security warnings
- Planning to notarize the app with Apple

**When ad-hoc signing is sufficient:**
- Testing and development
- Internal distribution within your organization
- Users can bypass Gatekeeper (right-click → Open)

### Automated Build and Package Script

The easiest way to build, sign, and package YSocial is to use the automated script:

```bash
# With ad-hoc signing (recommended for testing and local distribution)
./packaging/build_and_package_macos.sh

# Or with Developer ID for wider distribution
./packaging/build_and_package_macos.sh --dev-id "Developer ID Application: Your Name"
```

This script automatically:
1. Builds the executable with PyInstaller
2. Signs the executable with entitlements
3. Creates the DMG installer with signed .app bundle

The .app bundle signing happens during DMG creation, so there's no need to manually sign it afterward.

### Manual Build and Package Process

If you prefer to run the steps manually:

```bash
# 1. Build the executable
pyinstaller y_social.spec --clean --noconfirm

# 2. Sign the executable before bundling
codesign --force --sign - \
  --entitlements packaging/entitlements.plist \
  --timestamp \
  --options runtime \
  dist/YSocial

# 3. Create the DMG (which will create and sign the .app bundle automatically)
./packaging/create_dmg.sh --codesign-identity "-" --entitlements packaging/entitlements.plist
```

**Note**: 
- The `create_dmg.sh` script now accepts `--codesign-identity` and `--entitlements` parameters
- When these are provided, it automatically signs the .app bundle during DMG creation
- For production distribution with a Developer ID certificate, replace `-` with your Developer ID

## What the Entitlements Do

The `entitlements.plist` file includes these key permissions:

- **`com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`**: Allows the app to load libraries that aren't signed with the same certificate
- **`com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory`**: Allows Python's bytecode execution
- **`com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables`**: Allows dynamic library loading
- **`com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit`**: Allows Just-In-Time compilation (needed for some Python packages)

These entitlements are necessary for PyInstaller single-file executables because the extracted libraries won't have the same signature as the main executable.

## Verification

After signing, verify the executable works:

```bash
# Check signature
codesign --verify --verbose dist/YSocial

# Display signature details
codesign -dvv dist/YSocial

# Check entitlements
codesign -d --entitlements - dist/YSocial

# Test on another machine
# Copy dist/YSocial to another macOS machine and run it
```

## Notarization (Optional but Recommended)

For distribution outside the App Store, notarize your app:

```bash
# 1. Create a ZIP of the signed executable
ditto -c -k --keepParent dist/YSocial YSocial.zip

# 2. Submit for notarization
xcrun notarytool submit YSocial.zip \
  --apple-id "your-email@example.com" \
  --team-id "YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
  --password "app-specific-password" \
  --wait

# 3. Staple the notarization ticket
xcrun stapler staple dist/YSocial

# 4. Verify notarization
xcrun stapler validate dist/YSocial
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### App hangs at splash screen (even on build machine)
**Problem**: After signing, the app hangs at splash screen even on the machine that built it.

**Diagnosis Step 1**: Check if entitlements were actually applied:
```bash
codesign -d --entitlements - dist/YSocial
```

If you see an empty output or no entitlements listed, they weren't applied correctly. Follow the solution below.

If entitlements ARE listed correctly (you see all 4 keys), continue to Diagnosis Step 2.

**Diagnosis Step 2**: Check for signing-related issues:
1. Look for crash reports or errors in Console.app (Applications > Utilities > Console), filter for "YSocial"
2. Try building without the timestamp server (can cause delays/timeouts):
   ```bash
   ./packaging/build_and_package_macos.sh --no-timestamp
   ```
3. Check what processes are running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep YSocial
   ```

**Solution for missing entitlements**: The signing command must include entitlements with an absolute or relative path from project root:
```bash
codesign --force --sign - \
  --entitlements packaging/entitlements.plist \
  --timestamp \
  --options runtime \
  dist/YSocial
```

**Why this happens**: When using `--options runtime` (Hardened Runtime), macOS blocks library loading by default. The entitlements explicitly allow the app to load its own extracted libraries. Without entitlements, Hardened Runtime blocks everything.

### "Code signing blocked"
**Problem**: macOS blocks the app from running on other machines.

**Solution**: Sign with the entitlements file using the commands above.

### "The executable has been modified"
**Problem**: The signature is broken after modifying the file.

**Solution**: Re-sign after any modifications.

### "Killed: 9" when running the app
**Problem**: macOS killed the app due to signature issues.

**Solution**: 
1. Check signature: `codesign --verify --verbose dist/YSocial`
2. Re-sign with entitlements if verification fails

### App hangs at splash screen on other machines
**Problem**: Libraries are being blocked from loading.

**Solution**: 
1. Ensure you signed with the entitlements file
2. Verify entitlements are embedded: `codesign -d --entitlements - dist/YSocial`
3. Check for "com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation" in the output

## Why One-File Mode?

YSocial uses PyInstaller's **one-file mode** for distribution, which provides:

- **Simple distribution**: Single executable file, easy to download and share
- **No dependencies**: Everything bundled in one file
- **User-friendly**: No complex folder structures to manage
- **Smaller download size**: Compared to bundling all files separately

The entitlements approach allows one-file mode to work correctly on all macOS machines without switching to the more complex onedir mode.

## Summary

The key changes to fix the hanging issue:

1. **Added `entitlements.plist`**: Disables library validation for ad-hoc signed apps
2. **Updated `y_social.spec`**: References the entitlements file
3. **Updated signing procedure**: Use entitlements when signing the executable

After building, always sign with:
```bash
codesign --force --sign - \
  --entitlements entitlements.plist \
  --timestamp \
  --options runtime \
  dist/YSocial
```

This allows the PyInstaller executable to load its extracted libraries on any macOS machine.
